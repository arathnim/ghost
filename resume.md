## Bio

My name is Dylan Ball, and I live in Manhattan, KS, but I'm potentially willing to relocate, depending on the location.

I'm interested in programming language research, type theory, security, and interface design.
I dedicate most of my free time to writing Common Lisp, working both in and on the language;
with the goal of improving the ecosystem and language abstractions; generally making life easier for other developers.
I maintain a large amount of open-source applications,
most of which are on [github](https://github.com/arathnim/),
and documented [here on this site](#/projects/).

## Things I'm good at

#### Programming Languages & Domain Specific Languages

I've spent a lot of time turning complicated problems into slightly less complicated ones,
by building languages that allow programmers to easier manipulate elements of that domain.
Examples include [a command-line parsing language](#),
[a language that provides binding, matching, and destructuring](#),
and the [Wvyern programming language](#).

#### Web applications and APIs

I have experience with both front-end and back-end web tech, and know how to design user-friendly applications and strong, stable APIs.

#### Libraries and developer tooling

I dedicate most of my free time to developing and maintaining open source software,
writing and documenting watertight abstractions that can be used and reused.
I approach library interfaces from a user experience perspective as well as a technical one.

#### Teaching and technical writing

I like explaining things, and I know how to make complex topics accessible,
both in writing and in person. I write this blog, and document all of my software extensively.
