I'm interested in programming language research, type theory, security, and interface design.
I dedicate most of my free time to writing Common Lisp, working both in and on the language;
with the goal of improving the ecosystem and language abstractions; in general, making life easier for other developers.
I maintain a large amount of open-source applications,
most of which are on github,
and documented here on this site.

#### Programming Languages & Domain Specific Languages

I've spent a lot of time turning complicated problems into slightly less complicated ones,
by building languages that allow programmers to easier manipulate elements of that domain.
Examples include a command-line parsing language,
a language that provides unified binding, matching, and destructuring,
and the Wvyern programming language.

#### Web applications and APIs

I have experience with both front-end and back-end web tech, and know how to design user-friendly applications and strong, stable APIs.

#### Libraries and developer tooling

I dedicate most of my free time to developing and maintaining open source software,
writing and documenting watertight abstractions that can be used and reused.
I approach library interfaces from a user experience perspective as well as a technical one.

#### Teaching and technical writing

I like explaining things, and I know how to make complex topics accessible,
both in writing and in person. I write this blog, and document all of my software extensively.
